# Basic concepts for operating systems.

An Operating system is a program that manages all other applications program in a computer, users can interact with it trough a user interface, sometimes command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) 

For understanding fully an operating system you have to know what is it for and no matter what operating system we talking about it has 3 main purposes

- Resource management
- Program execution
- System management

In this guide we'll use it under a specific context, we will focus on linux, its general usage and common tools that will help us to manage it at our will.

# Kernel VS distributions

The linux kernel is the same base for all the distributions we can find, but is customizable under the needs of who will use it it can be customized in the next features (not limited to):

- Controllers - Special controllers for specific hardware.
- Security features - Firewall, disk encryption, etc.
- Performance optimizations - For better performance on CPU operations or RAM usage.

The distributions are the result of some of this customizations and other deeper ones, the main difference between them is the way the manage software they use that's why is common clasify it in:

- Debian based
- Pac-man based
- RPM based
- Gentoo based
- Slackware based
- Android based
- Source based

If you want a complete guide under the different linux distros on the market i suggest using this chart: 
![chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#/media/File:Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg)

And again this guide will try to be as general as possible, but we will use one of the mos popular debian-based distros, Ubuntu
